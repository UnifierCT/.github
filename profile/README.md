  Yes, we're also UnifierHQ</h1>
<p align=center>This Organization hosts work on Community Translations, so we can bring Unifier to more languages!<br>
<a href="https://github.com/UnifierHQ">Looking for UnifierHQ?</a></p>

----

## Why translate/localize?
Since we've made Unifier open source, we've diversified our mission from just connecting Discord servers to bringing
communities of any size together, no matter the platform. We want to build a **free, safe, and open** chatting space
for everyone, no matter the community or platform.

And building a space for everyone also involves making Unifier more accessible for everyone.

We want to bring Unifier to non-English-speaking users and communities as well, so everyone can use Unifier easily to
connect with others, no matter what language they speak.

----

## How can I contribute?
Please join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/a4KpNcARzK), then DM Green (Unifier project leader) and ItsAsheer
(Localization team leader) the following:
- Your GitHub username
- Why you want to help localize Unifier
- What languages you want to work on
- Your fluency on those languages

Once you have sent us the necessary information, we'll create a fork of Unifier for your language (if needed, forking
lets us sync the newest english.json file more easily to forks), then we'll grant you access to the repository.
